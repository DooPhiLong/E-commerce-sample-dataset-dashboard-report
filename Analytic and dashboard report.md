- We got 42k order have comment (41,76%) and quite good average score (4.07 / 5.0), 57,43% is 5 score and 3,23% is 1 score
- We got top 5 States and Product category have highest average score, and also top 5 bottom of it 
  - The things that cause customers to underestimate some products or services are because the quality of the product is not good, the product has been damaged during transportation, the shipping time is too long.....

# 6. Recommendation
- ðŸš© So, I believe that this E-commerce should:
  - Run creative seasonal marketing campaigns (vouchers, discounts...) with different products. Besides the best-selling items, we need to have marketing campaigns for the items that are not selling well.
  - Most of the reasons suburban areas have low product sales, small orders and slow delivery is because the geographical conditions of both customers and shippers are not guaranteed. Therefore, we need to invest in building freight stations in the suburbs so that customers in that area can easily order.
  - Marketing campaigns should be most active in the hours of 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, and 4pm, because that time is very crowded with free customers.
  - Continue to accompany domestic enterprises such as banking and financial services to upgrade customer service experience. Especially, the paid service
  - Should have automatic feedback tasks to thank customers when they have a positive review
  - Listen and record negative customer feedback about products and services... To find out the unreasonable points (price, quality, delivery, errors) and fix them
